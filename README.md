## Freelance Python Toolkit

This is my personal toolkit for freelance data projects.

It includes general-purpose scripts for:
- SQLite database setup & querying
- API data collection
- Web scraping
- Report generation

Project-specific deliverables are kept in a private folder and not included in this repo to protect client data.

Feel free to explore and reuse any of the tools here!
